# Kapotify | CMGT Hogeschool Rotterdam 
This is th code for my laravel project. It includes basic crud functionalities, user authentication and authorization, deeper validation, customizable profile and images, a post manager to toggle posts on and off and a page to manage user roles. I made this for my studies at CMGT Hogeschool Rotterdam.

Take a look!
